# Counterfactual-Policy-Learning-for-Safe-Decision
In this code, we formulate a multi-objective counterfactual policy learning problem to balance reward and harm and propose a principled policy learning approach for safe decision-making.

The "data_generateIHDP.py" and "data_generateJOBS.py" files include the data generation process.

We put our final data in the data folder, named "ihdp1_train_data" and "JOBS_train_data".

To recover our experiment results, please run and "main.py" and "SE_vs_AIPW.py" files.
